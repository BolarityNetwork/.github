# Welcome to the Bolarity repos!

**Bolarity** is a next-generation abstract blockchain solution focused on addressing the fragmentation in todayâ€™s multi-chain ecosystems. By unifying blockchain interactions, Bolarity reduces the complexity for both users and developers. Bolarity offers values as follows:

- **Pluggable Cross-chain Abstraction:** Enables any chain to allow users to directly interact with applications on other chains without leaving their current chain, while also supporting interoperability across heterogeneous VMs.

- **Intent:** Simplifies user interactions by automating complex processes through Bolarity, eliminating the need for users to perform cumbersome operations.

- **HybridVM Execution Environment:** Provides a hybrid VM execution environment that allows users to deploy high-efficiency smart contracts at low cost.

- **Cross-VM Application Synergy:** Offers a standard for cross-VM smart contract deployment, fully leveraging the strengths of different VMs to unlock the limitless potential of application development.
