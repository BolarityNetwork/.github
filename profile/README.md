# Welcome to the Bolarity repos!

# Introduction

Bolarity is a next-generation abstract blockchain solution designed to address the fragmentation in todayâ€™s multi-chain ecosystems. By unifying blockchain interactions, it empowers any chain to interoperate seamlessly, bringing cohesion to the blockchain world and eliminating fragmentation.

## Our three Products

### Synapse

- **Plugable Cross-Chain Abstraction:** Enables users on any chain to interact with applications on other chains using their native account, while supporting interoperability across different VMs without leaving their current chain.
  - **Account Abstraction:** Interact with any application across chains using a unified account, simplifying user identity management.
  - **Gas Abstraction:** Achieve interoperability with universal gas, eliminating the need to handle multiple gas tokens across different chains.
  - **VM Abstraction:** Interact with any virtual machine using a unified account, ensuring seamless operation across diverse VMs.
  - **Service Abstraction:** Users can interact with applications seamlessly without knowing or managing the underlying third-party services, as these integrations are fully abstracted and managed within Bolarity.

- **Intent:** Simplifies user interactions by automating complex processes through Bolarity, eliminating the need for users to perform cumbersome operations.
  - **Seamless Automation:** Bolarity automates complex processes, streamlining user interactions.
  - **Effortless Experience:** Eliminates the need for cumbersome operations, simplifying tasks for users.
  - **Enhanced Efficiency:** Simplifies interactions, allowing users to achieve their goals with minimal effort.
